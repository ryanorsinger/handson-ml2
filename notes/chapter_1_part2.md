## Underfitting

Main ways to address underfitting:
- select a more powerful model with more parameters
- Develop better features w/ feature engineering
- Reduce the constraints on the model; i.e. reduce the regularization hyperparameter


## Instance vs. Model Based Learning
- Model based: Build a model on training data, then generalize to new instances by using new instances as inputs to the model (Linear Regression)
- Instance based: load in all the training data, then generalize to new instances by using a similarity measure (K-Nearest Neighbors)

## Garbage In, Garbage Out
- Ensure that your dataset is sufficiently large
- Ensure that your dataset is sufficiently representatitive of the population

## Validation

Error rate in new cases is called "generalization error" or "out-of-sample error"
